# Demonstration
## What we'll build
[Final application](LINK-TO-FINAL-APPLICATION)

---

# How we'll build it

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left',fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>We have a git repository with all exercises (and slides)</li>
    <li>Each part has its own directory with assignments</li>
    <li>We will be working on the same application throughout the workshop</li>
	<li>So you can always see the solution, by peaking in the directory for the next part</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

# Demonstration
## How it is setup

---

# Assignments - Part 1

1. Clone or download the git repo - [github.com/bambuu/intermediate-react](https://github.com/bambuu/intermediate-react)
2. Open the project with your favorite editor
3. Run `npm run setup`
4. Run `npm run part1`
5. Make sure it works by visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# Working with lists
## Part 2

---

# Component keys

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left',fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <li>React needs a way to uniquely identify components</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>Usually this is handled by React</li>
    <li>But when you render <b>lists</b>, React can't do that automatically</li>
	<li>Therefore we have to add a <code>key</code> prop to each element in our list</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# What does React consider a list?

<!--- 
	GUSTAV:
	should we show a simple array here, in JSX, to describe what a "list" is in react?
	and then just afterwads say, that the way u usually do this, is with array.map.
	or is that a complexity we need to leave out?

	eg.

	<ul>
	 <li>not</li>
	 <li>a</li>
	 <li>"list"</li>
	</ul>

	vs.

	<ul>
	 {[
		 <li>this</li>,
		 <li>needs</li>,
		 <li>keys</li>
	]}
	</ul>
