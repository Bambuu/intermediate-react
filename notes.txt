- FIX PART NUMBERS - part 1 is actually part 2 (part 1 in slides is welcome)


- Should we reorder the methods in controlled-final.js, so they are in order of appearance instead of the "correct" order?

- dont have extra assignment components in the assignment file, have them along with the others

- Extra Assignment height ???

- Consider running setupAll in parallel

- classnames inside HeroList or not?

    - Movies component says it'll be implemented later..?

- Refactor components from "App" out into seperate components

FINAL CHECKLIST:
    - Ensure not-important directory are the same throughout exercises
    - Synchronize so app is the same component everywhere
    - streamline npm run vs npm run partX
    - add react routing to all package.json
    - make
