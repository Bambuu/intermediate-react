Decision points:
- Should we remove the withRouter functionality post-part4?
- Should we reorder the methods in controlled-final.js, so they are in order of appearance instead of the "correct" order?
- Refactor components from "App" out into separate components

- Extra Assignment height ???


Work to be done:
- Consider running setupAll in parallel
- change assignments to markdown
- run prettier on the whole shebang

MARKDOWN:
  Talk markdown syntax

  Convert .md to html?

FINAL CHECKLIST:
    - Tjek at refs er v√¶k alle steder
    - Last proofread
    - Ensure not-important directory are the same throughout exercises
    - Synchronize so app is the same component everywhere
    - streamline npm run vs npm run partX
    - add react routing to all package.json
    - make
