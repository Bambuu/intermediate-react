Decision points:
Don't manually implement scrolling?

Work to be done:
- Consider running setupAll in parallel
- change assignments to markdown
- run prettier on the whole shebang - BUT NOT SLIDES! (it removes () around function parameters)
- Maybe pick some nicer colors?

FINAL CHECKLIST:
    - Tjek at refs er v√¶k alle steder
    - Last proofread
    - Ensure not-important directory are the same throughout exercises
    - Synchronize so app is the same component everywhere
    - streamline npm run vs npm run partX
    - add react routing to all package.json
	- delete src-copy folders
    - check no lint errors
    - Streamline assignment / exercise capitalization
    - make
