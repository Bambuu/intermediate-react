// Welcome to the first exercise!

/*
EXERCISE A:
Let's get the app running. Inside your terminal, navigate to the /part1 directory and type "npm run start"

You should see a list of superheroes pop up in your browser at localhost:3000

Tip: You might have to run npm install inside this directory if you get an error that packages are missing.
To do this for all the parts at once, go into the root "intermediate-react" directory and run "npm run setupAll"

/*
EXERCISE B:
We have a list of superheroes here. But we'll want to be able to add our own superheroes.
For that we'll need a form. We'll want to be able to specify the name of our superhero,
and how evil they are.

Find the render() function inside the HeroList. Inside the JSX returned,
add a <form> element.

Inside the <form> element, add two <input> elements.

  EXERCISE C:
	You should now have two input elements, where you can enter things. But
