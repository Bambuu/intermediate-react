# EXTRA ASSIGNMENT - READING LIST

If you have some extra time, before the rest of the group is finished, here's an extra exercise:

## EXTRA EXERCISE A
Start becoming familiar with the different files and components inside the `src` folder.

We'll be using the same app throughout, so you might as well get familiar with it.
Start by Reading `HeroList.js`, and if you finish that, move on to `App.js`, `Sidebar.js` and `index.js`
