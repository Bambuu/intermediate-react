# ASSIGNMENT ONE - Hello World


## EXERCISE A:
When situated in the root "intermediate-react" dir, in a terminal, run the command

`npm run setupPart1`

After that is done, run:

`npm run part1`

A browser will appear out of thin air, showing you a list of superheroes
page on `localhost:3000`

That means it's working!

Now let's start setting the rest of the parts up. Run `npm run setupAll`

This will take a while. In the meantime, there's an extra
assignment in the next file!
